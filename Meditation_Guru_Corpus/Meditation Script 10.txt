Lie down on your back in the most comfortable position you can find. 
Adjust everything - your body, your position, your hair, your clothes - until you are completely comfortable.
For the duration of this meditation there should be no physical movement.
Close your eyes and keep them closed until you are advised to open them.

Sleep may come but you should try to stay completely awake for the duration of the practice. 
During this meditation you should use only the sense of hearing. The only thing you need to do is follow my voice.
