Set your intention and quietly say to yourself the following affirmation: “I give thanks for my health and the joys of living and being alive.”
Sit in a comfortable position and give yourself permission to relax and unwind for two to ten minutes.
Turn your attention to your breath and listen to the sound and movement of your everyday breath flowing softly in and out through your nose (if you wish you can close your eyes).
On your next breath, slowly breathe in and quietly count “one.”
Breathe out and count “two.”
Breathe in and count “three.”
Breathe out and count “four.”
Continue counting your breaths up to ten.
When you reach number ten, go back to number one and repeat the practice for two to ten minutes.
If your mind wanders during the practice and you lose concentration, that’s okay. Just return your attention back to your breath and begin counting from number one.
And when you are ready, if your eyes are closed, slowly open your eyes and notice what has changed about your mind’s state and the energy of your thoughts.
